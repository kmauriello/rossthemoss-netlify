# Forthcoming children's book
Ross the Moss is soon to be a children's book series, inspired by a very symmetrical and beautiful lump of moss I found outside my apartment in Southern Oregon. This repo contains the code for the Ross the Moss website.

# How I made this site
I created the HTML and CSS files from scratch, then I connected this repo to Netlify to deploy the site.
